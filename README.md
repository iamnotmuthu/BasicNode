Modules are reusable components which are bundled together with a name - modulename.(Similar to library)
There are 3 types of Modules
  1) Modules which are created by us
  2) Third party Modules
  3) Core modules.
  We shall reuse all above modules with help of require keyword
  module is a keyword which is available by default.
  npm is a package manager, similar to maven. Used to package and import third party modules.
  All info about modules will be present in node_modules folder.
